An online music recommendation system.

There are many online music services which are similar to what we frequently watch and listen and then give a rating. To suggest the best possible recommendations for users, there are possible ways which are content-based and collaborative filtering. In this system we have implemented all of them to find out which algorithm is best suited for an online music recommendation system. Collaborative filtering includes item-item, user-user and latent factor. All of these types have different methods to recommend songs to the user so that they find it easy to listen to what pleases them.

Online music services have tens of millions of tracks. The content itself is broad and covers various musical genres as well as non-musical audio content such as radio plays and podcasts. The sheer scale and diversity of content make it difficult for a user to find relevant tracks. Relevant recommendations are therefore crucial for a good user experience. Here we present a method to compute track-track similarities using collaborative filtering signals with side information such as artists, country, age, etc.
